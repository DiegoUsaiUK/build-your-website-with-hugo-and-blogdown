# build-yourwebsite-with-hugo-and-blogdown
How I used RStudio, GitHub and Netlify to create and deploy your own webpage

This year has been rather rewarding for me! After completing some of the excellent Business Science University courses, I have worked on a number of Customer Analytics & Business Intelligence projects and summarised them into technical articles that I published on Medium’s Towards Data Science. This opened up an entirely new world to me and generated many new connections within the analytics and data science community the world over!

The idea to create my own website has been at the back of my mind for a few months. So far I’ve used [__RPubs.com__](https://rpubs.com/) (the free web publishing service from RStudio) as a portfolio of sorts but I knew I needed a personal web-space. That would give me the freedom to showcase my work in a more professional way, accommodate articles that I didn’t necessarily want to publish, and personalise with links to favourite blogs/books/sites as well as my social media platform (LinkedIn, GitHub, Medium, etc.).

When Matt Dancho got in touch in early October 2019 to say that he liked a number of my articles and wanted to feature some of them on his blog, I knew I could no longer wait. So I put on hold the project I was working on and I gave myself a week to come up with a minimum viable product to put online.

8 days later, I was super excited to deploy diegousai.io!

And Matt Dancho has even been kind enough to feature my newly created webpage on his 23-Oct-2019 webinar SQL for Data Science!
