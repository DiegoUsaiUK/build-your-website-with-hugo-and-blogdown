# Build Your Own Website with Hugo and blogdown
## How I used RStudio, GitHub and Netlify to create and deploy your own webpage

28 October 2019

This year has been rather rewarding for me! After completing some of the excellent [__Business Science University__](https://university.business-science.io/) courses, I have worked on a number of __Customer Analytics__ & __Business Intelligence__ projects and summarised them into technical articles that I published on __Medium__'s [__Towards Data Science__](https://towardsdatascience.com/@diegousaiuk). This opened up an entirely new world to me and generated many new connections within the __analytics and data science community__ the world over! 

The idea to __create my own website__ has been at the back of my mind for a few months. So far I've used [__RPubs.com__](https://rpubs.com/) (the _free web publishing_ service from __RStudio__) as [__a portfolio of sorts__](https://rpubs.com/diegousai) but I knew I needed a personal web-space. That would give me the freedom to __showcase my work in a more professional way__, accommodate articles that I didn't necessarily want to publish, and personalise with links to favourite blogs/books/sites as well as my social media platform ([ _LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegousaiuk), [ _GitHub_](https://github.com/DiegoUsaiUK), [ _Medium_](https://medium.com/@diegousaiuk), etc.).

When [__Matt Dancho__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho) got in touch in early October 2019 to say that he liked a number of my articles and wanted to feature some of them on [__his blog__](https://www.business-science.io/blog/index.html), I knew I could no longer wait. So I put on hold the project I was working on and I gave myself _a week_ to come up with a _minimum viable product_ to put online.

8 days later, I was super excited to deploy [__diegousai.io__](https://diegousai.io/)!

And _Matt Dancho_ has even been kind enough to __feature my newly created webpage__ on his _23-Oct-2019_ webinar [__SQL for Data Science__](https://github.com/business-science/presentations/tree/master/2019_10_23_lab_21_SQL_for_Data_Science)!
